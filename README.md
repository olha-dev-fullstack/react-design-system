# Design System Monorepo

This project explores different approaches to developing a **design system from scratch**. It is structured as a **monorepository** and consists of several custom packages, each responsible for different layers of the system. The repository is also equipped with tools for testing, documentation, and accessibility.

## ðŸ“¦ Monorepo Structure

```
packages/
  â”œâ”€â”€ react/       # All React UI components
  â”œâ”€â”€ foundation/  # Basic shared utilities and foundational components
  â””â”€â”€ scss/        # SCSS variables, mixins, and shared styles

playgrounds/
  â””â”€â”€ react/       # Sample app for testing components in real scenarios
```

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Custom Component Library**: Built with React, following best practices for scalability and reusability.
- **Design Tokens & Styling**: Centralized SCSS package to manage variables, themes, and styles across components.
- **Foundation Layer**: Core utilities and simple building blocks used by the main components.
- **Storybook Integration**: Visual documentation and testing of UI components.
- **Unit Testing**: Written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for test coverage and reliability.
- **Accessibility Support**: Includes keyboard navigation support for components like `<Select />`.
